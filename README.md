# DS1-project

## Should you judge a book by its cover?

In this project, we analysed dataset of bestselling books available on Amazon Website to gain insights into the characteristics and trends of popular books across different genres.
Our goal is to use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to explore relationships and patterns within the data, and to develop a deeper understanding of the book market.
The dataset contains information on following attributes : The columns in the dataset are:
- URL : web address of the book
- Title : Title of the book
- Price: Price of the book
- five_star_rating : Number of five star ratings/100
- four_star_rating : Number of four star ratings/100
- three_star_rating : Number of three star ratings/100
- two_star_rating : Number of two star ratings/100
- one_star_rating : Number of one star ratings/100
- overall_rating : Overall rating on the book
- No_of_ratings : Total number of ratings
- cover_img_url : Url of Image of Book cover
- genre : Genre of book

We will use this data to investigate questions such as:
- What are the most popular genres among readers?
- How do book prices vary across genres?
- Are there any relationships between book ratings and prices?
- what are some common characteristics of top-selling books?
We will be employing a range of visualization and data analysis techniques, including histograms and box plots. Through these methods, we hope to uncover valuable insights into the book market.

We scraped the data for **54 genres** using requests and scraperapi for this project.

**In this project, I handled the Image feature extraction section.**

Note: This project was done as a part of a certification course at Univ.AI.
